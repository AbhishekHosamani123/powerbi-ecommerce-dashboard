# Power BI E-commerce Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project is a **Power BI E-commerce Dashboard** built as part of my Data Analytics course. The dashboard is designed to help e-commerce businesses **track product growth, analyze sales performance, and make data-driven decisions**. Users can view growth trends by product, category, and state, along with other insightful metrics to optimize business strategies.

## Key Features
- Track **sales, revenue, and order volume** over time.
- Analyze **product performance** and identify top-selling items.
- Monitor **customer behavior and segmentation**.
- Compare growth and sales across different **states/regions**.
- Interactive visualizations for **drill-down analysis**.
- Filters and slicers to focus on specific **products, time periods, or regions**.
- Insights to **support business decisions** for marketing, inventory, and expansion.

## Data Analytics Steps
The dashboard was developed using a structured **Data Analytics workflow**:

1. **Data Collection**  
   - Collected e-commerce sales data, product details, and customer information from sample datasets.
   
2. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and standardized data formats.
   - Ensured consistency in date, product, and regional information.
   
3. **Data Transformation**  
   - Created calculated columns for metrics like **profit margin**, **growth rate**, and **average order value**.
   - Aggregated data by product, category, and state for visualization.
   
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Analyzed trends in sales, revenue, and orders.
   - Identified top products, high-performing regions, and seasonal trends.
   
5. **Data Modeling**  
   - Built relationships between **sales, products, and customer tables** in Power BI.
   - Optimized model for faster report performance and interactive analysis.
   
6. **Visualization**  
   - Designed charts, tables, and maps to highlight key metrics.
   - Added slicers and drill-down features for interactive exploration.
   
7. **Insights & Reporting**  
   - Interpreted trends and patterns to provide actionable insights.
   - Prepared the dashboard for stakeholders to monitor business performance and make informed decisions.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI Desktop** – for dashboard creation and data modeling.
- **Excel / CSV** – as the primary data source.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** – for calculated metrics.
- **Power Query** – for data cleaning and transformation.

## How to Use
1. Open the `.pbix` file in **Power BI Desktop**.
2. Use the slicers to filter by **product, category, state, or time period**.
3. Explore interactive charts and tables to analyze sales trends and product performance.
4. Export insights or share the dashboard with stakeholders to support business decisions.
